# Why should you switch to [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord)?
Well, take a look at the other popular Android Discord mods:

### Bluecord:
* ❌ No Discord Server (Skill issue, just make a discord)
* 🤷‍ Run by a somewhat secretive developer, and therefore is shady (probably safe, but be careful)
* ❌ Not open source (for some reason)
* Has some patches and some themes, but you cannot make them yourself (from what i've seen)

### CutTheCord (CTC):
* 🤷‍ Has no discord, but does have an IRC-type chat
* ❌ Only updates every so often (master branch is v56 aka really old and default branch is Alpha 87202)
* ❌ Some plugins, but seems to not really be modular
* ❌ looking at the patches code gave me even more brain damage
* 🤷‍ More friendlier with APKs, its up to you lol

### Treecord:
* 🤷‍♂️ Does have a discord
* ❌ No plugin / theme support (afaik)
* ❌ Need to install through a script (not idiot proof)
* Doesn't even seem to have anything besides a dev tag, what
* Last update April 17 2021 (likely very old discord version)

## Introducing Aliucord, the latest and greatest in Android Discord modding:
* ✔ A pretty good discord 
* ✔ Latest version is Beta 96.3 (96103) at the time of writing
* ✔ (most) Plugins and themes are created by users (themes have varying levels of quality because of this, however)
* ✔ Plugins/Patches are made in Java/Kotlin with [Pine](https://github.com/canyie/pine) instead of enchantment table patches
* ✔ No need to rebuild/install a different APK for more plugins!

I don't know about you, but there's an obvious choice you should be making right now...
