# Why should you switch to [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)?
Well, take a look at the other popular Android Discord mods: <sub>_Last updated: Feb 04 2022_</sub>

### [Bluecord](https://bluesmods.com):
* ‚Åâ Semi-active discord server; The owner Blue is not very active there.
* ü§∑‚Äç Bluecord is run by a secretive developer (named "Blue"). You use what is added in Bluecord at your own risk.
* ‚ùå Blue claims he has plans to open-source Bluecord, it is not known whether it was said to promote his "good reputation" or not.
* Bluecord is _not modular_, meaning what he adds is all you get.
* Runs an aging version of discord (94.11/94011)
* Unrelated: Blue has a negative reputation from interactions of his previous mods and attitudes :trollface:

* ‚ùå Has not updated since August 2021 (really old discord by now)
* ‚ùå You have to rebuild the APK to add a new patch.

* ‚ùå Need to install through a script (not idiot proof)
* Doesn't even seem to have anything besides a dev tag, what
